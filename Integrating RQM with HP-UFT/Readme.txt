There was a requirement from the management team and the CI/CD team to explore integration possibilities for UFT and RQM. Hence started
exploring it and took help from the CLM Business support team aswell and finally was able to achieve this. 
This is a utility available on jazz.net This is helpful when there is RQM and HP-UFT testing tools in the same environment.
This tool integrates RQM with HP-UFT and once this is done, we will be able to start a HP-UFT test case from RQM's Test Execution Record.
The utility will run the test case in HP-UFT and report back the reslts into the RQM's TCER.
CLM Business support team prepared this doc, but this was repeated in my local environment and tested again.
