While supporting several development and test teams of IKEA who are using Jira and Confluence, and also after working on 
Jira and Confluence for some time now, I realized that the user community may need to have a feature in the Confluence to embed certain
Jira fields inside confluence pages so as to build some custom reports.
Hence did a lot of research and came up with a user macro. Though this was not originally coded by me, I took the code and did 
more modifications so as to suite our user's requirements.
The email chain has all the details.
