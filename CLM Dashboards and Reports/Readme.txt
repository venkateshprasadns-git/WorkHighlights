This document details most of the possible reports that can be built in CLM , both using the JRS (Jazz Reporting Services) reports 
and the default reports at the project level.
Reports built by these two methods can then be published in a dashboard which can then be shared with stakeholders.
The dashboards were mainly built for the Test Teams to handle Multichannel releases and the reports had live data which was used by
all test teams for their daily stand ups and it was used by the top management teams to get the overall release status across all teams
